      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Identified problem</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/problem.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
      <p>Business meetings are the fastest way of growing up your business. Meeting with people means 
        creating new connections, exchanging ideas and evolving. The problem is that you meet new 
        people whose names you forget the next second you hear. The simplest solution would be to use 
        business cards in order to keep track of your new acquaintances, but these either end up in the 
        trash or in a drawer and when you need them, searching through them is a time consuming process. 
      </p>
      <p>Another problem identified is beeing at a social gathering where you meet new people, or even known people, 
        you socialize and at the end you realise that you have been chatting with someone all night and you did not 
        exchange phone numbers or even Facebook progiles. This is the moment when you realise that you can not keep 
        in touch with that person until the next gathering (maybe).
      </p>
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Proposed solution</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/solution.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
      <p><b>Bizy</b> is a cross-platform application that allows both the exchange of personal data with somebody else in a 
        simple and quick manner and a fast searching engine. Just by touching your phone, your profile is automatically sent to 
        the other user: name, phone, email, social media profiles, job related info and anything else 
        that comes to your mind, using the additional data field.
      </p>
      <p>Our application also allows you to get the list of participants from a certain event that you attended using the 
        <i>Maybe you know</i> list. If they want to share their profile with the other guests, you may quickly link to them and 
        find out, for example, who can become your next employer.
      </p>
      <p>Bizy can be simply used by anyone, even if they are teens or adults, even if they are students. Anyone 
        can create their profile and exchange data. 
      </p>
      <p>Our product is oriented in saving the environment. By using <b>Bizy</b>, the consumption of the 
        materials that business cards are crafted from will drop and an increase in productivity will be 
        spotted. The application brings lots of gains both for people and environment. 
      </p>
      </p>
      <!-- Customer Segment -->
      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Targeted customer segment</h3>
      <img src="./resources/customers.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
      <p>
        The targeted segment is the business segment because business meetings end up with cards 
        exchanges. This segment can benefit from our fast exchange application that will increase their 
        productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the business segment is not the only one targeted by <b>Bizy</b>. Anyone can use our application 
        because it is easy and has an intuitive interface. Even if you are a student, maybe at an interview 
        you have the occasion to exchange data with your interviewer, or maybe you meet someone at a 
        social event that gets interested in your background experience and it end up with you beeing hired. 
        The application will help you exchange data with anyone and will increase your professionalism.

      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Identifying the problem</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/identify.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
        <p>
          The idea appeared when one of us was taken to a business meeting by his father. After long 
          discussions, all the participants exchanged these coloured, small pieces of paper named business cards.
          The first question that came into his mind was: "Why do they still use these paper cards when they can use
          their smartphones? It has to be an application for that.".
        </p>
        <p>
          After some research, at that time, there was no application for 
          doing this exchage quick and simple. Moreover, the people that were involved in the meeting were asked the same question and they replied 
          that they do not know about such an application, but it would be useful and more esier to search through all of 
          these cards when you need an info. Also, asked to be honest and say what are they going to do 
          with what they received, they said that probably it will be kept in a stack full of other 
          business cards in their office.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that moment, we could only conclude that is was not the right time for such an upgrade because 
          it could not fulfill the needs of the people that would use it and also that there is a problem that can be solved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some years later, we are still asking people the same question, what are the advantages and disadvantages 
          of using paper business cards, what do they think about using their phone in order to exchange these data 
          and why do they still feel the need of using these cards.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Solution for the problem</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/sol.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
        <p>
        Having the clear problem in mind, we decided that the solution that would best solve it is connecting people 
        attending the same meeting easier with their most used tool, smartphones.
        </p>

        <p>
        We believe in Bizy as an application that will be capable of storing the relevant information for a person and 
        be ready to exchange it at any moment. The person will allow Bizy to share the data that he desires from his profile. The core 
        is time effieciency and increase in producitivity because the more people connect and build together, the better 
        projects are developed.
        </p>

        <p>
        Moreover, our connecting application can be used as a searching and information gathering tool regarding the 
        events attended and its people. A standard feature we consider is "Maybe you know". A curious mind can use this 
        feature to discover certain persons with similar interests or job roles, eager to get in touch.
        </p>

        <p>
        Bizy also understands the problems the environment is facing and aims to help by providing the online alternative 
        of traditional printed bussiness cards. Migrating into online encourage people to stop producing a considerable 
        ammount of paper, that most of the time ends up lost between documents.
        </p>

      </p>
      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Plan for customer discovery</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/customer_discovery.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
        <p>
          In order to gather usefull information about the potential client we thought that it would help to give questionnaires to young people,
          fresh graduates or bachelor students mainly (an easier segment due to the fact that we can reach the segment faster), people in the business
          environment (the segment we think that is going to embrace our solution the most) and older people(the segment from which we don't expect the 
          most clients but we wanted to know how much our idea represents a solution for them too because it is important when creating the MVP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching the first segment of potential clients is easier because the age difference is not that big and the communication is easier. We are 
          interested in finding out how they transfer information between them currently, not focusing on things like chatting but more precisely what the 
          chatting contains(e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or any other form of identification). This segment is somehow volatile, new applications are 
          created quite frequentely and we would need to keep up with the pace in order to keep the interest as fresh as possible with easy access to the 
          newest application after the accounts would be shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the second segment we are interested to see if the problem we are trying to solve is actually a problem for them. Because we know we address 
          to business people we know that the information transfer is more formal(e-mail addresses, calls, conferences) and each information needed for 
          this kind of communication usually is represented by another account which needs to be somehow shared, process that may take quite a while 
          considering personal preferences and the evolution of such methods of communication. To reach this segment we could give questionnaires to 
          people we know from our internships, people from companies that we worked or work for, and ask our acquiantances to spread the word and pass the 
          questionnaire we created.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the third segment is important to gather information about what are the main methods to communicate(face to face, online, calls, etc.). This 
          information is usefull because there is a high chance that the potential clients from this segment may not use diverse methods of communication so 
          if our idea would sound good for them, we would probably need to adapt our solution in such a way that it is not only providing a way of accessing an 
          existing method but integrate it in order to provide a familiar and at the same time new experience. 
        </p>
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading1"><br>Validating the problem using gathered data</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="./resources/valid.png" alt="Bogdan" style="width:20%">
      </p>
      <p>
      	We have shared our form in various places, and we have got 86 responses.
  		<p>For the demographics, we have more male responders than female responders, and the age group that is represented in the strongest fashion is the 18-24 year old people.</p>
        <div id="piechart"></div>
        <div id="piechart1"></div>
  		<p>About half of the people who answered claimed to participating to social events at least once a week, with about 37% participating at least twice a week to such events.</p>
        <div id="piechart2"></div>
  		<p>The most popular data to exchange is the name, phone number and Facebook profile, although we cannot ignore the company and role in it, the Instagram profile or the E-mail address, each of these having at least a 29% popularity among the respondents.</p>
        <div id="chart1"></div>
  		<p>The most common solution, by far, used by our responders was the phonebook, although on the second place (at about 18% of the responses) we notice physical business cards as being a semi-popular choice.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Saving_contact_details.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>As for the most common complaints, two issues have been encountered by more than half of our respondents, namely forgetting to exchange contact details between the participants and simply not getting to know all of them. A few other responses that have showed up in the responses relate to knowledge about the events themselves, as in knowing the host, how formal the event is or the kind of event in the first place.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Difficulties.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>If our responders were to create their own profile to be easily shared, they would choose to share simple contact details, such as name, profile photo, phone number and E-mail address. A significant amount of responders also said that they want to share what company they work at and their role there as well. Relatively fewer want to share LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and other social media profiles.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Profile_self.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>The most preferred method to share such a profile is via a mobile/web app, although a public profile available on a social media website seems to also be preferred by half of our respondents. Business cards are also chosen by nearly one third of them.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Profile_sharing.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>As for places where such a contact data exchance feels needed, there are four situations which are roughly equally represented: Parties, interviews, business meetings and first encounters.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Context.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>More than 66% of our respondents participated in at most 5 business meetings, although a non-negligible amount (about 15%) were at the other extreme and have participated at more than 25 such meetings. Roughly similar proportions can be noticed in the data for the amount of physical business cards that each responder has used.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Meetings_count.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>Most of our respondents store away business cards after receiving them, although slightly more than a quarter copied the data somewhere else and threw away the card itself; these two categories make up more than three quarters of the responses we've received altogether.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Cards_fate.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>Users have various reasons to consider business cards attractive, including but not limited to ease of use, completeness of the information, ease of use or ease of storing them away. As for cons to using them, more than 60% of our users consider that pollution (from the ink and paper/metal) and the fact that the information on them easily goes out of date make up the most important issues with them, though 40% of users simply consider them unpopular.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Cards_pros.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Cards_cons.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>For the data exchanged at business meetings, most of our respondents shared names, phone numbers, E-mail addresses, as well as the company they're working at and their role there. A less popular but still notable data point, at roughly 28%, is the LinkedIn profile.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Data_shared_business.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>As for issues in using business cards, nearly 60% of our respondents complain about failing to associate the business card with the actual person they received it, thus making the business card less useful. Other two issues that were popular and tied for second place, at roughly 43%, were one of the participants not having a business card and thus having to write down the info on either paper or the phone manually.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Data_exchange_issues.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>For the data that the respondents actually look up in the business cards, the recurring pattern of name, phone number, mail address, company and role within the company shows up again.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Data_lookup.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>The problems actually encountered by the respondents can be split in the following categories: data on the cards becoming outdated, failing to find the person among too many business cards, or the info on said cards being irrelevant anyway.</p>
        <img src="resources/graphs/Data_lookup_issues.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
  		<p>As for how much the respondents would spend on an app that would resolve the problem, a quarter wouldn't spend anything, a third would spend up to 2$, while another fifth would spend between 3$ and 5$. In total, nearly three quarters of the responses are up to 5$, and more than half are up to 3$.</p>

          As result of our validation campaign, the results from our surveys are very encouraging. As a majority of our
          possible client base, we have answers
          from young adults and adults that are participating to social events more than one time per week, business
          events or casual events. In terms
          of what information is exchanged between individuals, when they want to keep in touch with each other
          there are a couple of elements
          that come to our attention:
          <b>name, phone number and Facebook profile.</b>
          All this information is saved on the phone of each individual in their phone's contacts and on Facebook app.
        </p>
        <p>
          An encouraging fact for us is that people signaled a need in providing, through an app, a personalised profile that
          they want to share with other new peers in their
          social context. From our data, they want to share the most:<b> a profile picture, name, company name and phone
            number.</b> Moreover, one of the most
          important challenge that they face in big events is that they don't have the opportunity to get to know
          all people.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the key challenges that we have observed with the traditional contact card are: the information on the
          card could become outdated and the card can be
          easily lost. There is one thing to mention, it can exist an unfortunate moment when a person doesn't have a card
          when the cards are exchanged and this can become
          frustrating for all the parts involved.
        </p>
        <p>Presenting our solution, most of the people that answered the survey showed interest for the idea even if the service
          could be a charged product.
