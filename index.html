                  your business. Meeting with people means
                  creating new connections, exchanging ideas and evolving. The problem is that you meet new
                  people whose names you forget the next second you hear. The simplest solution would be to use
                  business cards in order to keep track of your new acquaintances, but these either end up in the
                  trash or in a drawer and when you need them, searching through them is a time consuming process.

               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">Another problem identified is beeing at a social
                  gathering where you meet new people, or even known people,
                  you socialize and at the end you realise that you have been chatting with someone all night and

                  exchange phone numbers or even Facebook progiles. This is the moment when you realise that you
                  can not keep
                  in touch with that person until the next gathering (maybe).

               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250"><b>Bizy</b> is a cross-platform application that allows
                  both the exchange of personal data with somebody else in a
                  simple and quick manner and a fast searching engine. Just by touching your phone, your profile
                  is automatically sent to
                  the other user: name, phone, email, social media profiles, job related info and anything else
                  that comes to your mind, using the additional data field.
               </p>
               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250"> Our application also allows you to get the list of
                  participants from a certain event that you attended using the
                  <i>Maybe you know</i> list. If they want to share their profile with the other guests, you may
                  quickly link to them and
                  find out, for example, who can become your next employer.
               </p>
               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">Bizy can be simply used by anyone, even if they are
                  teens or adults, even if they are students. Anyone
                  can create their profile and exchange data.
               </p>
               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">Our product is oriented in saving the environment. By
                  using <b>Bizy</b>, the consumption of the
                  materials that business cards are crafted from will drop and an increase in productivity will be
                  spotted. The application brings lots of gains both for people and environment.

                  you have the occasion to exchange data with your interviewer, or maybe you meet someone at a
                  social event that gets interested in your background experience and it end up with you beeing

                  The idea appeared when one of us was taken to a business meeting by his father. After long
                  discussions, all the participants exchanged these coloured, small pieces of paper named business
                  cards.
                  The first question that came into his mind was: "Why do they still use these paper cards when
                  they can use
                  their smartphones? It has to be an application for that.".
               </p>
               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
                  After some research, at that time, there was no application for
                  doing this exchage quick and simple. Moreover, the people that were involved in the meeting were
                  asked the same question and they replied
                  that they do not know about such an application, but it would be useful and more esier to search
                  through all of
                  these cards when you need an info. Also, asked to be honest and say what are they going to do
                  with what they received, they said that probably it will be kept in a stack full of other
                  business cards in their office.

               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
                  For that moment, we could only conclude that is was not the right time for such an upgrade
                  because
                  it could not fulfill the needs of the people that would use it and also that there is a problem
                  that can be solved.

               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
                  Some years later, we are still asking people the same question, what are the advantages and
                  disadvantages
                  of using paper business cards, what do they think about using their phone in order to exchange
                  these data
                  and why do they still feel the need of using these cards.

                        fresh graduates or bachelor students mainly (an easier segment due to the fact that we

                        environment (the segment we think that is going to embrace our solution the most) and

                        Reaching the first segment of potential clients is easier because the age difference is
                        not that big and the communication is easier. We are
                        interested in finding out how they transfer information between them currently, not
                        focusing on things like chatting but more precisely what the
                        chatting contains(e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or any other form of identification).
                        This segment is somehow volatile, new applications are
                        created quite frequentely and we would need to keep up with the pace in order to keep
                        the interest as fresh as possible with easy access to the
                        newest application after the accounts would be shared.

                        to business people we know that the information transfer is more formal(e-mail
                        addresses, calls, conferences) and each information needed for

                        considering personal preferences and the evolution of such methods of communication. To
                        reach this segment we could give questionnaires to
                        people we know from our internships, people from companies that we worked or work for,
                        and ask our acquiantances to spread the word and pass the
                        questionnaire we created.

                        information is usefull because there is a high chance that the potential clients from

                        if our idea would sound good for them, we would probably need to adapt our solution in
                        such a way that it is not only providing a way of accessing an
                        existing method but integrate it in order to provide a familiar and at the same time new

                              of what information is exchanged between individuals, when they want to keep in
                              touch with each other
                              there are a couple of elements
                              that come to our attention:
                              <b>name, phone number and Facebook profile.</b>
                              All this information is saved on the phone of each individual in their phone's
                              contacts and on Facebook app.
                           </p>
                           <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
                              An encouraging fact for us is that people signaled a need in providing, through
                              an app, a personalised profile that
                              they want to share with other new peers in their
                              social context. From our data, they want to share the most:<b> a profile
                                 picture, name, company name and phone
                                 number.</b> Moreover, one of the most
                              important challenge that they face in big events is that they don't have the
                              opportunity to get to know
                              all people.

                              card could become outdated and the card can be
                              easily lost. There is one thing to mention, it can exist an unfortunate moment
                              when a person doesn't have a card
                              when the cards are exchanged and this can become
                              frustrating for all the parts involved.

               <h3>Conclusion</h3>
               <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
               <p>As a conclusion, we found out that people would like to use an application that is able to
                  store all the data about their contacts. Mostly, the idea is validated, but we found out other
                  features that people would like to see.</p>
               <p>The <b>"aha moment"</b> was when we found out that people would willingly share their data with all
                  people
                  around in order to find out what they are searching for. This means that our application may become
                  a little bit similar to a socializing platform where people offer and request things.</p>
               <p>The main focus for now is the swing between keeping an application that is portable and only keeps the
                  contacts that you have (you exchanged data with) and the "maybe you know" contacts, and an application
                  that is able to keep data from all the people around the world that want to share their knowledges
                  with
                  the others. The later one may involve some GDPR practices, but it may be more useful that the first
                  one.</p>
               <p>Stay tuned in order to find out more about our progress.</p>

                  We made a couple of changes to the landing page in order for it to be more appealing to the public as

                     when the page loads the user sees a how our application looks and can download it; changed the logo

                  could reach.
                  The main social platforms were Facebook and Whatsapp and, as we will see in the following sections,
                  these two brought
                  us the majority of the views on the landingpage.

                  started to access the landingpage in a relative short period of time.

                  We were interested in finding out what content from the page presents the most interest for the
                  potential clients.
                  As it can be seen the hottest zones are represented by the state of the application and the download
                  options,
                  especially the Google Play button. From the total number of clicks on the page, we summed up a
                  <b>percent of 17,24</b>

                  A very important part of the research is based on the mobile interaction with the landing page due to
                  the fact
                  that our product will mainly be available for Android and iOS. Even though the mobile version of the
                  page was not
                  very user-friendly, we still obtained a total number of <b>101 clicks</b> from the total number for
                  the accesses on mobile,
                  representing <b>15,25%</b>.

                  After sharing the landingpage for a certain amount of time, we discovered that users from all around
                  the world
                  gained interest in our product and social media publicity played an important role in spreading the

               <h3>POTENTIAL MARKET SHARE</h3>
               <p>A very critical phase in the life cycle of Bizy was the process of selecting the right category to
                  feature our solution, since each category has its own details and strategies. Thus, in all
                  ecosystems,
                  both in the App Store and Google Play and even among Web applications, our application falls into
                  the
                  “Social” group.</p>

               <p>The “Social” category accounts for almost 15 percent of the total applications so far in 2020 on
                  the
                  App Store, while the same category represents almost 10 percent of the total Google Play market. It
                  might not sound like much, but in both app stores, the “Social” category is in the top 5 app
                  categories, out of almost 40 categories in all with a promising future.</p>
               <p>In order to provide appropriate initial market share and market share estimates
                  for the first 5 years after the launch of our application, by evaluating the average
                  number of downloads each application has on Google Play.</p>

                  include at least 1.5 million users. Therefore with respect to major rivals,

               <p>It was important to identify a collection of goals for the next 5 years in order to be able to
                  provide a well-founded forecast regarding the market share of our application. So, we expected that
                  in terms of active users, all our rivals will face an exponential decrease of 6 percent each year.
                  Our key advantages are the ease of use and the fact that we developed an all-in-one solution, a
                  more robust application compared to competition. We want those users to move to our solution.</p>

                  As you can see above, after 5 years, we have set the target of being responsible for making life in
                  the kitchen simpler and healthier in the top 3 applications, with a market share slight above 30%.
                  Eatics will be the second at the same top if the pattern were retained, which will be both a bold
                  ambition and a huge accomplishment for us.
